#### In order to begin the bike trip analysis for investors, the data in "tripduration" was converted to a datetime datatype with the use of VS code and Jupyter Notebook as attached above. This conversion was necessary in order to provide the correct information and format for time and bike trips for the investors.
#### After the conversion was complete, visualizations were created. First, a visual on checkout times for users was created based off which times the bikes are checked out.
